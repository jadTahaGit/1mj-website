      how: "What Nate was seeking was a coach to help him get to his next level of discipline, structure and business. Seeing as they're all connected to each other, we first focused on creating the structure that would facilitate becoming disciplined. After a few weeks of that focus, we started to concentrate more on his business as a Fitness and Mindset coach. We worked on limiting beliefs as well as brainstormed on potential strategies for him to find the right clients to work with. We're currently still working together and Nate keeps leveling up with each passing month!",

I've realized it's incredibly invaluable having someone on your team that can help you get to your next best version, always pushing you to become better. I 100% recommend Dez to anyone and everyone looking to take a serious step forward in life and achieve their goals.",

      successGoal: 'To get his self-discipline on another level, to spend less time with distractions and increase productivity towards his business goals.',
      how: "Working with John was and is an awesome experience. This guy came in motivated to crush it since day 1 and just needed someone to hold him accountable and to reflect/strategize with. But whenever we'd set the plan up, he was sure to execute it. And that's exactly why he's seeing the results he's seeing. He has advanced on his path and only greater things are to be expected ahead! With his newfound work ethic, consistency and dedication, soon enough I'm sure he'll have one of the most popular and successful gyms in Florida.)",

He is absolutely crushing it in his University while also doing amazing work in his job as a developer. But that's not all! We were also able to get him to improve his fitness, his relationships and his health & success habits. All through quality time management! And if you thought all of this was a lot, Jad is also currently part of a project that will soon become a company. He is one of the founders and also acting as the Senior Developer of that project. This guy has so much on his plate and he's still able to be killing all of it! It's no coincidence. He is very coachable, has an amazing attitude and always respected what I had to say and received feedback in an extremely humble manner.",

      successGoal: 'To reflect weekly on the events of his personal and business life. To become free from patterns of self-limitation which originated from past situations.',
      how: "Wolf Ausch, a business owner from New York, hired me to guide him through some personal issues, to figure out what the right hobbies would be for him, and also for help with his business — either direct advice or just brainstorming sessions. I was able to help Wolf with all areas of his life. Whether we were just trying to tackle a personal issue or his mindset, our sessions were always successful. Through our sessions, Wolf was also able to come to unique realizations about himself (sometimes just while talking to me. I just subtly guided him through self-reflection) When it comes to business, whenever he needed to make a business decision, reflection or even brainstorm session, we were also able to find tremendous success! Wolf has since affirmed that some key changes that have taken place in how he carried himself are making him feel happier and more at peace than ever before. This collaboration is still ongoing to this day! And it wouldn’t have been so successful without Wolf’s openness to discuss anything about his life.",

All she needed was someone to keep her accountable, someone to help her deal with feeling overwhelmed, and someone she could reflect with for guidance. Thanks to our collaboration (as well as amazing efforts from her!), she has been able to get an amazing promotion as well as achieve a great deal of personal growth. And it was all about staying focused on what matters the most! It's not about how much you do, it's about how important what you do is.",

      how: "Kos had become so involved in his work that he forgot he needed to make time for his personal life as well. By this I mean, moments that he would truly enjoy. After a few sessions of stimulating his introspective thoughts, were able to find some activities that brought him the wonderful feeling of joy! Activities that he made sure to become a regular part of his week from then onward.",

      successGoal: 'To become truly self-disciplined. To have systems implemented and to be extremely productive every week.',
      how: "He always respected what I had to say and he always followed through. He didn't slack. He saw me as someone he respected and didn't want to let down. And that was the secret to his success! As the sessions progressed, thanks to Anas’ willingness to be open about his thoughts and feelings, we realized that there was a lot to work on internally. Anas had insecurities in certain areas of his life and one of them was suffering from impostor syndrome as well as simply having a low sense of self-worth. Beyond the work we did during our sessions, I advised him on some books to read and he said they also had a tremendous impact! Of course, we also talked through all of his issues in our sessions and, ultimately, I think it’s safe to say we defeated those issues. Nowadays Anas has his own full autonomy and doesn't need a coach for accountability anymore. It was a pleasure to work with this client!",
      testimonial: "It was a life-changing experience working with Dez. Very simply put: Before working with him, I was a lost individual. I had no self-image, no morning routines, no schedule, no nothing. I really needed proper direction and clarity... And after working with Pedro, things changed completely! I started writing Journals, reading books, suddenly I had new and bigger standards, it was an incredible transformation! (even today I still look back proud of my development) Basically, I was able to achieve all my goals thanks to Dez.",

      how: "Crystal published the book between the first and the second session! It was truly amazing and a show of commitment from her. She was one of the fastest clients to achieve results that I’ve ever had. She was incredibly humble and always listened attentively while taking many notes. Couldn’t have asked for a better client! Fortunately, all suggestions I made had a very positive impact on her life and she is now in a much better place and feeling much more confident! All that while being a devoted mother to multiple children and a wonderful wife to her husband!",

      occupation: 'Assistant Football Coach',
      successGoal: 'To grow as a person and as a leader so that one day he can become a highly skilled Head Coach of a top-tier football club. Plus, to be held accountable to his goals.',
      how: "Frederico is an amazing example of what a great coaching client looks like. He was ALWAYS extremely coachable and always open to suggestions & feedback. He was always eager to learn and improve. He never assumed anything and always heard what I had to say with an open mind. That’s all I ask. Naturally, this has resulted in huge personal growth for Frederico and I couldn’t be any more proud of him for all the work he has put into improving himself. Naturally, he isn’t a Head Coach yet because in the football (soccer for the US) world seeing a coach younger than 35 be signed to a top club is, to this day, unheard of. However, every day he is working towards making sure that it will happen one day, and that when it does happen, he’s ready for it and at the top of his game.",
      testimonial: "Dez showed to have a great understanding of how to help you out in all aspects of your life (work, home, dating). He listens carefully and asks the right questions that will help you reflect about the topics you're about to tackle together. I wish I found Dez earlier, as I know how powerful and life-changing his help can be!",
