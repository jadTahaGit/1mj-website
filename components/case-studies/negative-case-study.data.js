Furthermore, he never carried out what we both agreed to do on the calls, and eventually, he just gave up and “ghosted” me. I need you to be coachable and to RESPECT the sessions. Otherwise, I can’t help you.",

I can’t do anything to help you if you just give up. And I absolutely need you to be coachable. Otherwise, you’ll just be wasting both of our time. You wouldn’t hire a personal trainer and then not go to the gym, right?",
